    "In the first chapter, we introduced some basic problems and ideas of probabilistic programming and probability. Now, let's review some of those concepts in greater detail. Recall the Example 1.2 of A/B Testing from the introduction, in which we used the binomial distribution in our probabilistic model to generate data. This chapter will explain why the binomial distribution was the best choice for that example.\n",

Likewise, if the probability of an event occurring is closer to $0$, then that event is more likely to not occur than to occur.

From now on, we are going to use the quantified outcomes (i.e. random variables) and instead of working with a sample space (that remains unchanged, $S=\\{fever, coughing, sneezing\\}$), we are going to use the <a id='range'>*range of a random variable*</a> ($R(X)=\\{1,2,3\\}$), which is defined as the set of all values a random variable can take on. \n",

    "## Continuous Distributions\n",
    "---\n",
    "A random variable (or a distribution) is *continuous* if the range of a random variable are values within a continuum and thus can have an infinite number of values within a range. The probability function for a continuous distribution is called a <a id='pdf'>*probability density function*</a> or PDF. Unlike the probability mass function, the probability density function doesn't describe a probability of a specific outcome (a probability of event $X=k$ where $X$ is a random variable and $k$ is a value from the set $R(X)$). Since there are uncountably many possible outcomes, the probability of a single outcome to happen equals zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine water drops falling on a rectangular table. The surface of the table consists of uncountably many points. What is a probability that a drop will fall exactly in the middle of the table? There could be many drops that will fall very close to the middle of the table, but the probability that a drop will fall exactly in the middle or at any other specific point on the table is zero. Still, it is possible to note the areas where more drops fall compared to other areas in the case where drops of water come from a sprinkler that is located on one side of the table, or maybe drops cover table uniformly in the case where it is raining. The probability density function describes how dense the outcomes are distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"media/chapter2/table.png\" width=\"700\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "How can one measure density? Let's suppose one side of the table is $5$ ft long, and keep track where the drops fall only with respect to this side of the table. We want to see how the drops are distributed after the rain has been falling for a while. Let's put $5$ containers on the table, each $1$ ft wide, so that each drop falls into one of them. Then after a while we evaluate how many drops fell into each container and obtain a histogram with $5$ bars. Now, let's instead consider $10$ containers each $6$ inches wide, then $20$ containers each $3$ inches wide and so on. As we increase the number of containers and decrease their width, the density of the number of points per container) is getting closer to the density at the specific point. In other words, the histogram is getting closer and closer to a probability density function.\n",

The PMF (or PDF, depending on the situation) are used in probabilistic programming when sampling the data (the sampled data are proportional to the prior distribution; this will be explained in greater detail in the next chapter). Also knowledge of common distributions such as the binomial or gaussian distributions allow for a more informed decision when constructing a generative model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2.9.** You are given a dataset that describes the number of Hawaiʻi Police Department (HPD) traffic incidents per day between July 15 and October 15 of 2018 (92 days total). Previous studies have shown that there is a sudden increase in the number of incidents during the given period of time. A research group has determined that the average number of incidents before the increase is 186 and the average number of incidents after the sudden jump is 224. Your job is to determine on what day the increase happened.\n",

Recall that it has a parameter $\\lambda$ that is the expected number of incidents happened during the day. If you expect traffic behavior to be the same during these 92 days, then the number of traffic incidents occurring each day is generated by the Poisson distribution with the same parameter (prior) $\\lambda$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the information received however, we know about a sudden jump. This means the generative model has to be adjusted accordingly. \n",

Since it should happen somewhere between Day 1 (July, 15) and Day 92 (October, 15), we use discrete uniform distribution with parameters $a=1$  and $b=92$.\n",

    "  lam_2 = 224\n",
    "```\n",
    "Our model has to generate the data, namely it has to generate a number of incidents for each of 92 days where number of incidents during the day is generated by Poisson distribution with either parameter `lam_1` or `lam_2`. Therefore, we want to generate an array of 92 elements, each with a Poisson distribution with parameter equal to either `lam_1` or `lam_2` depending on the `switch` variable. So first of all, we need to create an array `lam` that will keep track of which of the parameters has to be used for chosen day.\n",

    "`pm.math.switch(CONDITION, A, B)` returns `A` if `CONDITION==true` and returns `B` otherwise. Since `day` is an array, `day < switch` is an array of 1's and 0's. For each element of array `day < switch` `pm.math.switch()` returns either `lam_1` or `lam_2`, which makes `lam` an array as well.\n",
    "\n",
